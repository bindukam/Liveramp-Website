			<h3>People-based marketing is the new industry standard</h3>

            <?php include 'inc/colorbar.php' ?>
            
			<p>The most effective marketers know they need to be activating based on a realistic, combined view of the people they’re marketing to.</p> 

			<p>But they also know they can’t spend months waiting for IT to connect all their data for them. And they can’t scale the all-too-manual approaches that hardworking marketers adopt when they’re taking matters into their own hands.</p> 

			<p>Identity resolution makes people-based marketing possible, without exhausting your resources.</p>
