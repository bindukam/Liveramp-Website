            <p>Strategic tech stack integration comes in many forms for marketers. It depends on the maturity of your marketing activities and the ambition of your goals.</p>

                <h3>Manual Reconciliation</h3>
                <p>The most basic kind of integration is when a group of marketers manually merge spreadsheets, poring over them looking for data quality issues. For the longest time, this was how the CMO’s annual report came together, but it’s inefficient and labor-intensive.</p>

                <h3>Integration tools</h3>
                <p>A more streamlined (but still labor-intensive) approach involves a single marketer writing simple if this, then that workflows within web-based integration software that collects and sends data between two or more cloud-based systems. </p>

                <h3>Partner-led</h3>
                <p>Then there’s traditional integration. This could involve IT resolving more substantial technology silos with API-based manual workarounds for cloud services. But it often also includes an integration partner providing professional services to support big on-premises integration between multiple systems of record and data warehouses.</p>

                <p>These three approaches are all valid, proven ways to integrate your tech stack. But if you zoom out, the whole point of integrating a martech stack is to get a more well-rounded view of your customers without over-burdening internal resources in the process.</p> 

                <p>It’s about reconciling multiple identities from multiple platforms and partners so you can market to people based on a complete view of them.</p> 

                <p>So integration is less about the tech—it’s about identity.</p>
