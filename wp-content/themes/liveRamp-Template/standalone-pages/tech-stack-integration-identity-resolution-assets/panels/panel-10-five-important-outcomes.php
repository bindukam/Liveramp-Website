								<h3>Broaden and synchronize your data sets and advertising partner relationships</h3>
								<div class="outcomes-diag-mob"><img src="<?php echo $asset_link; ?>/assets/images/important-outcomes-1-n.svg" alt=""></div>
								<p>The first obstacle to executing more people-based marketing is simply making your first-party data available to the right platforms and partners.</p> 

								<p>LiveRamp’s identity resolution technology and our integrations with over 500 platform partners makes internal data instantly actionable. Our Connect platform is an external, self-service bridge to which marketers can push disparate online (and onboarded offline) datasets.</p>

								<h3>Improve ad effectiveness</h3>
								<div class="outcomes-diag-mob"><img src="<?php echo $asset_link; ?>/assets/images/important-outcomes-2-n.svg" alt=""></div>
								<p>This is the really powerful part. Once your online and offline first-party data (from CRM systems, loyalty programs, POS systems etc.) is uploaded through Connect, you can start reconciling it against the anonymous identifiers (like cookies and mobile IDs) flowing in from all your digital touchpoints.</p>

								<p>By resolving your first-party data with anonymous digital engagement and existing customer profiles or identities, your digital advertising effectively becomes more people-based. You can craft more personalized ads based on de-identified attributes at an optimal cadence.</p> 

								<p>Better yet, you can actively suppress ads to avoid wasted media spend.</p>

								<h3>Create a near-real time measurement feedback loop</h3>
								<div class="outcomes-diag-mob"><img src="<?php echo $asset_link; ?>/assets/images/important-outcomes-3-n.svg" alt=""></div>
									<p>Once you’re running more people-based digital advertising, you can start measuring effectiveness down to individual transactions. By tying campaign exposure data back to incoming purchase data—either on-site or in-store—you can see which customers converted after viewing which ads. You can do this for both individual campaigns and over time across different campaigns.</p>

								<h3>Perform people-based incrementality testing</h3>
								<div class="outcomes-diag-mob"><img src="<?php echo $asset_link; ?>/assets/images/important-outcomes-4-n.svg" alt=""></div>
									<p>People-based incrementality testing can help uncover the most effective combination of content, frequency, and channel in your digital advertising. </p>

									<p>It starts by taking two large groups of resolved customer identities and running slightly different campaigns between them to measure the effectiveness of a specific element.</p> 

									<p>So if you send one group an email coupon and run banner ads, do they convincingly outperform a group that only received the email coupon? People-based incrementality testing is a highly accurate way to determine the impact of specific marketing activities.</p> 

									<p>You aren’t just seeing the performance of the ad in the context of multiple identifiers that may or may not have been resolved, you’re seeing how real people reacted.</p>

								<h3>Increase data lake transparency</h3>
								<div class="outcomes-diag-mob"><img src="<?php echo $asset_link; ?>/assets/images/important-outcomes-5-n.svg" alt=""></div>
								<p>One advanced use of identity resolution is to bring its ability to integrate different datasets to the place you need it most—a data lake. This could be stored internally or externally.</p> 

								<p>Here, you use identity resolution to bring those capabilities to where your data lives. That way, as you’re running various tests, you can rest assured that you’re recognizing the same people across channels in a privacy-conscious way.</p> 

								<p>Your data scientists can trust the data they’re using, and crucially, they don’t have to spend 80% of their time trying to build and manage the integrations or data feeds themselves. They don’t even need IT’s help.</p>
